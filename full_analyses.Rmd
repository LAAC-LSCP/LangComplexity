## Read in data

```{r read-in}
all_data<- read_excel("./Data/CR_by_child-updated_21_01.xlsx")

#definitions
mydata$age <-  as.numeric(coalesce(mydata$`Age in months`, mydata$Age)) #combining age of both datasets
mydata <- mydata %>% 
  filter(age <= 40) #after this your data reduces to 120 observations (<40) which you care about.

mydata$syl_comp <- factor(mydata$`Syllable complexity`, levels=c("Low","Moderate","High"))

table(mydata$ChildID)[order(table(mydata$ChildID))]

mydata_clean=mydata[,c("age","lang","syl_comp","C_count","V_count","CR")]

```

## TODO

1) make sure that all eaf's are in osf & go from eaf to CP
2) figure out how to go from zooniverse to cr
3) get CP data from the other CP project
this comes from osf.io/d4pvh


4) create merged dataset with both data from eaf & data from zooniverse

- why do we have a separate spreadsheet for tsimane?
- are there missing children?
