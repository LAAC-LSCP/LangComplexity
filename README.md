## 1. Launch the Binder

Click on the badge to launch the Binder:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/psilonpneuma/LangComplexity/master)

## 2. Run `LangComplex.R`

**TO DO:** :vertical_traffic_light:

1. In the top right corner, click "New" :arrow_right: "Rstudio"
2. In the console (the left-side panel) in Rstudio, type `source("LangComplex.R")` and press return

**N.B.:** If you save this notebook, it **will not** be saved to the GitHub repo.
Pushing changes back to the GitHub repo through the container is not possible with Binder.
**Any changes you have made to files inside the Binder will be lost once you close the browser window.**

## 3. Make changes to the repo

Download GitHub Desktop and follow [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop) to clone the current repository. 
You can make changes to the code locally on your machine which will be tracked automatically. To push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub, click *Push origin*.
Next time you launch the binder these changes will show up.
