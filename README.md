You can either make changes to the analysis pipeline, or simply reproduce the pipeline.

##  To make changes to the analysis pipeline

You need to be a coauthor of this github repo. Ask Chiara or Alex to add you.

You may need to download GitHub Desktop and follow [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop) to clone the current repository.  You only need to do this once.

From now on, you can make changes to the code locally on your machine which will be tracked automatically. To push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub, click *Push origin*. Next time you launch the binder these changes will show up.

To get changes others have made, click "pull".

## To reproduce the pipeline:

1. Launch the Binder

Click on the badge to launch the Binder:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/psilonpneuma/LangComplexity/master)

2. Run `LangComplex.R`

**TO DO:** :vertical_traffic_light:

1. In the top right corner, click "New" :arrow_right: "Rstudio"
2. In the console (the left-side panel) in Rstudio, type `source("LangComplex.R")` and press return

**N.B.:** If you save this notebook, it **will not** be saved to the GitHub repo.
Pushing changes back to the GitHub repo through the container is not possible with Binder.
**Any changes you have made to files inside the Binder will be lost once you close the browser window.**
