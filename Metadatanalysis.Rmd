## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
data_2 <- read_delim("MetaData.csv", delim=',',col_types = cols(.default = "c"))
nb_answers_new <- data_2 %>%
  group_by(ChildID) %>%
  count()
print(paste("Number of Clips:", nrow(nb_answers_new)))
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
